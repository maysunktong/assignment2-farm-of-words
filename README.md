Harvest Hints is a Wordle-inspired game where player selects a farm-related category and try to guess the correct word.

## Game flow
> Harvest Hints is handled by two main functions: `startGame()` and `playGame()`
> <br> `startGame()` - handle name input and game options leading to main gameplay or `playGame()`
1. Game initialization
- User inputs name
- User chooses options [0] & [1] to go further to category prompt(`playGame()`) or change name (restart `startGame()`)
2. Main Gameplay
- User's max attempts is set/reset
- User chooses a category in a prompt
- User guesses a word based on the category chosen
- Each guess is evaluated. Left attempt decreases.
- Evaluate a game: win or lose
- On game ending modal, user can choose to restart or exit game.


## Things I have learnt from this project
- `continue;` can be used only within loops. It is useful for staying on a remaining progress.
- `CANCEL` and `OK` in `prompt("")` is handled by `prompt === null` and `promptCategory.trim() === ""` respectively
- `CANCEL` and `OK` in `confirm("")` is easy to handle by using booleans in an if-else statement, and no need to trim string since it does not require an input
- To be able to restart a game, separate main gameplay out so it is easy to manage and call
- Writing a simple RegExp to evaluate if the input is letter-based.
- function `checkGuess()` for checking a right letter but wrong spot turned out to be more challenging than I thought. It did not work simply by using `.includes("")`. 
- The function works by labelling all letters in array as false and unused. Then, proceed to check right letter ‚úÖ in the first loop. The last loop checks for the right letter but in wrong position üê•. It does not check on wrong letter in wrong position since we filled them at the start of function.

**Solution** 
```javascript
const checkGuess = (guess) => {
    // fill every letter in array as ‚¨õÔ∏è, as default
    let feedback = Array(MAX_WORD_LENGTH).fill("‚¨õÔ∏è");
    // fill whole array unused letter
    let usedLetters = Array(MAX_WORD_LENGTH).fill(false);
    // then check if its correct and right position, then green
    for (let i = 0; i < MAX_WORD_LENGTH; i++) {
      if (guess[i] === randomWord[i]) {
        feedback[i] = "‚úÖ";
        usedLetters[i] = true;
      }
    }
    // loop to check ‚¨õÔ∏è if correct letter but wrong spot
    for (let i = 0; i < MAX_WORD_LENGTH; i++) {
      if (feedback[i] === "‚¨õÔ∏è") {
        for (let j = 0; j < MAX_WORD_LENGTH; j++) {
          if (!usedLetters[j] && guess[i] === randomWord[j]) {
            feedback[i] = "üê•";
            usedLetters[j] = true;
            break;
          }
        }
      }
    }
    return feedback.join("");
  };
```
